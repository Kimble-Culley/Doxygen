This program takes the parameters for each \mbox{\hyperlink{classEmployee}{Employee}} and stores it into an object. From there they can either go into a subclass, \mbox{\hyperlink{classSupervisor}{Supervisor}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{classOfficer}{Officer}}. All three have their own calculate\+Pay fucntion based on hours worked, and hourly rate. \mbox{\hyperlink{classSupervisor}{Supervisor}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{classOfficer}{Officer}} have unique calculate pay that is based on more parameters. They all have the same aniversary functionality. Along with each is a unique print funciton that will print the information associated with the \mbox{\hyperlink{classEmployee}{Employee}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classSupervisor}{Supervisor}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{classOfficer}{Officer}}.
